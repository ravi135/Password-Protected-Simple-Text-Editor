# SimpleTextEditor
This is a simple text editor but user can password protect their text files in this editor.
Project is completely written in Java.
User need to build whole project in a java IDE (eclipse,IntelliJIdea etc) in order to run the project.
I have used SHA-256 algorithm to encrypt passwords of the user.
SHA stands for "Secure Hash Algorithm". SHA-256 algorithm generates a 32 byte hash code.
